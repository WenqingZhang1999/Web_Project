			<h3>COM1001 Introduce to Software Engineer</h3>
			<p>It is a challenging module arming to develop individual ability of Ruby programming(left upper corner) and their team spirit (lower right corner) in building the simple software. In the personal part,we should be familiar with Ruby to achieve the function which has been separated into appropriate part as the picture shows that I am trying to define a method called priceOfShoppingSelection to calculate the price of some item.The other one, as we all know, it is always needed to be good at working with others which really needs us to be patient and have a good communication.</p>

		<h3>COM1002 Foundations of Computer Science </h3>
		    <p>From my perspective, this module solves my confusion in how the mobile electronic device could have intelligence when processes the data. And it mainly tells us the basic principle of logic structure in computer devices.For example, the Quantifier is made of the elementary logic word,” AND”,”OR’’ and “NOT”.</p>

		<h3>COM1003 Java programming</h3>
		<p>Have you be surprised how the dinosaur is be produced in terminal? That is one of the many functions of java using pixel point to draw in terminal. In the left picture, we could read in data from a file consist of the odd and even string character which will distinguish which part of pixels belong to dinosaur and which part is the background.  </p>
